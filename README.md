4ch-to-mw
=====================
This is a crappy-ass python tool that can be used to recompile a 4chan thread (or sup/tg/ archive) to a mediawiki dump.

Why? Because...well. Threads after 5 on wiki.magicalgirlnoir.com are hard to read because. This was originally coded in bash. Thank god nobody saw that mess.

Read the header for usage, for now. I'll make proper console syntax sometime soon. For now though; it works.

You need:
 * python2
 * lxml
